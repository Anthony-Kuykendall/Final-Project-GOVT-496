# Final-Project-GOVT-496
This will serve as the repository for my final project.
Additionally, I will begin to edit it so that I can add more comprehensive information about my project here. Maybe even an abstract?
But wait, I can also edit from my local machine? That could be helpful if I do not have an internet connection!
