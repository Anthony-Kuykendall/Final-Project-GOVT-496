# Final-Project-GOVT-496
This is the repository for my final project on DCPS School Closures and racial biases.

There are three folders: Code, Data, and Docs.

The paper, as well as a presentation given in class can be found in the Docs folder.
The code for all of the plots and nifty R things can be found in Code.
The actual data used in the paper is found in Data.
